# MiniRT - Requirements
## ?
- If applicable, all possible intersections and the **inside** of the object must be handled
correctly.
<br>=> "inside" ?
- Your program must be able to apply translation and rotation transformation to
objects, lights and cameras (except for spheres and lights that cannot be rotated).
<br>=> "apply transformations" == runtime ?
- Light management: spot brightness, hard shadows, ambiance lighting (objects are
never completely in the dark). You must implement Ambient and diffuse lighting.
- Your program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the .rt extension.
	- Each type of element can be separated by one or more line break(s).
	- Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more space(s).
	- Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
	- Elements which are defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in the scene.
<br>Questions:
	- "can be" == all in one line possible ?
 	- can any input be absent ? (e.g. default color ?)
- Camera: `C -50.0,0,20 0,0,1 70`
	- identifier: C
	- x,y,z coordinates of the view point: -50.0,0,20
	- 3d normalized orientation vector. In range [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis: `0.0,0.0,1.0`
	**- FOV : Horizontal field of view in degrees in range [0,180]: 70**
		<br>=> what about vertical field of view (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view))
## OK
- Your program must be able to resize the object’s unique properties: diameter for a
sphere and the width and height for a cylinder.
<br>=> resize == runtime ? => no.
- You must use the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating
system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will
need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above in Common
Instructions part.
- The management of your window must remain fluid: switching to another window, minimization, etc..
- You need at least these 3 simple geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder.
- the program displays the image in a window and respect the following rules:
	- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
	- Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
	- The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.

### Input
Each element first’s information is the type identifier (composed by one or two character(s)), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict order such as:
- Ambient lightning: `A 0.2 255,255,255`
	- identifier: A
	- ambient lighting ratio in range [0.0,1.0]: 0.2
	- R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: 255, 255, 255
◦Light: `L -40.0,50.0,0.0 0.6 10,0,255`
	- identifier: L
	- x,y,z coordinates of the light point: `-40.0,50.0,0.0`
	- the light brightness ratio in range [0.0,1.0]: `0.6`
	- (unused in mandatory part)R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: `10, 0, 255`
◦ Sphere: `sp 0.0,0.0,20.6 12.6 10,0,255`
	- identifier: sp
	- x,y,z coordinates of the sphere center: `0.0,0.0,20.6`
	- the sphere diameter: `12.6`
	- R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: `10, 0, 255`
