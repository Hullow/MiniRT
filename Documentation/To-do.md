# MiniRT

## Things we have to do
- Make it work

## Things we want to do
- Do computations in parallel
- [Make a good readme](https://www.makeareadme.com/)

## Done
- Parsing: read model files, create data structures to store input
- Use MiniLibX to handle windows and draw pixels
- Use function pointers in C => no real usecase here
- Use tagged unions in C => not used, using a generic struct t_object with fields
that can be left empty
