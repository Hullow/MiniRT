# 20/2/25
- At 42 with pberset, discussed task list
- Going through Ch.1 RT Challenge: *Tuples, Points, Vectors*
- Coordinate choice: left-handed, like the book (see Implementation.md)
- Implemented math functions abs_float() and is_equal_float()
- Tuples: implemented tuple type, tuple init functions point() and vector(), 
tuple manipulation functions add_tuple(), subtract_tuple() and is_equal_tuple()
- To do next time: test tuple manipulation functions
