# 20/2/25
- At 42 with pberset, discussed task list
- Going through Ch.1 RT Challenge: *Tuples, Points, Vectors*
- Coordinate choice: left-handed, like the book (see Implementation.md)
- Implemented math functions abs_float() and is_equal_float()
- Tuples: implemented tuple type, tuple init functions point() and vector(), 
tuple manipulation functions add_tuple(), subtract_tuple() and is_equal_tuple()
- To do next time: test tuple manipulation functions

# 21/2/25
- Discussed floats vs double with pberset, decided to use float (less space)
- Tuples: wrote some basic tests of functions, added NULL checks, finished writing functions, need final tests for dot-product and cross-product
- Preparing to merge
