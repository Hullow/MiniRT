# Optimisation un peu
## to delete
* Sphere.diameter && cylinder.diameter useless after matrix transform scaled
* cylinder.height useless after scaled transform

## to reduce
* assign values -> set transform with scale, rotate, translate
* all other values ar always defaults, could be set immediately apart

## to reference
* Use matrix references to reduce computations assignment and micro-scopes
* objects references same reason

## to verify
* leaks
* norm
* camera orient / plane normal ?
